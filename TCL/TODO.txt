- try neutral conversion with -k 0
- crop with 16bit-capable tool; affects accuracy and maybe zero samples
- extrapolate colors outside measured range
- take calls to "glob" into "catch"
- protect from reading intermediate files from a different converter (?require name in comment?)
- check why settings files aren't overriden when RawTherapee is open AND THERE'S NO ERROR MESSAGE
- enable analyzing grey targets while no RAWs of the real photos exist
- default RAW converter set to Corel, while the system tried to go with CaptureOne

- known problem: depth-override entry doesn't permit having an empty string during editing; hard to fix

- include a test for preferences rollback - triggered by missing last preference value
