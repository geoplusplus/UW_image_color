Main steps
-------------
1) Arrange inputs under the work directory
It should look the following way:
TODO: dir-tree with comments

2) Start UWIC application
Double-click on the provided shortcut. See TODO for how to setup the shortcut for your system.
(Code/CLI: Load the code.
  source <CODE_PATH>/setup_uw_image_depth.tcl )

3) Choose RAW converter.
Select the appropriate name in "RAW converter" combobox.
(Code/CLI: Set the TODO variable in raw_converters.tcl)

4) Select the work directory
Click "Folder" button and choose the directory by means of the built-in standard folder-selection dialog.
(Code/CLI: make it your current directory in TCL console)

... The following 3 steps achieve separation of gray-target RAWs from those of the ultimate photos. One can do it without UWIC, but UWIC can greatly simplify the procedure.
In the end, the RAWs of the ultimate photos should stay in the root of work directory, while the RAWs of gray targets should move into RawColorTargets/ subdirectory.

5) Extract thumbnails from RAWs.
Places thumbnails of all the images under Thumbnails/ subdirectory.
Click "Extract Thumbnails" button
(Code/CLI:   TODO)

5) Move thumbnails of gray targets into the dedicated subdirectory - Thumbnails/RawColorTargets/.
Use a standard file-manipulation tool from your OS.

6) Run a command that moves the real RAWs of gray targets into their own directory; the further choice of which RAWs are gray targets is based on location of their thumbnails.
Click "Sort Thumbnails" button.
(Code/CLI:  TODO)

7) In your RAW  converter perform 'Click-White-Balance' on all gray targets and ensure their settings files (converter-specific) are saved under your work directory. See TODO.

The following 3 steps meant to (a) build a formulae to compute color at any relevant depth, and (b) estimate depth for each ultimate photo.

8) Read the dive-log and build time-to-depth map for the dive.

9) Process the gray targets and build depth-to-color map.

10) Run a command to filter the depth-to-color map so that all the readings in it are consistent. Consistency means the greater is the depth, the stronger is the warming color correction.
Note, because of the odd 3-parameter control of white balance in RawTheraphy, the result may look counterintuitive. Consistency rules for color-temperature and primary tint apply only to gray-target readings with equal secondary tint.

Click "Process Depth Data" button for (8), (9) and (10).
(Code/CLI:  ProcessDepthData)

11) Using your RAW converter, provide initial settings' files for all the ultimate photos.
The UWIC tool will only override white-balance numerical parameters in _preexisting_ settings' files. Thus initial settings files should have WB mode set to 'manual'.
Use "paste-into-many" feature if your RAW converter has it.

The following 2 steps achieve initial but usable WB parameters TODO
12) Create image-to-depth-and-color map for the ultimate photos.

13) Run a command to override white-balance parameters in the settings' files for the chosen RAW converter.
Click "TODO" button for (12) and (13).
(Code/CLI:  ProcessUltimateRAWs)

14) Review and edit RAW images in the converter. If needed, change depth for some images in depth-override file and run a command to override settings' files for the affected images; see TODO:ref.
Click "TODO" button.
(Code/CLI:   ProcessUltimateRAWS 1)


====================
Depth override
====================
There are several reasons for wishing the colors to be computed for a depth different from the one measured by the dive-computer:
1) Camera pointed upward; this may make the image span a rather large range of depths; one has to choose which part of the image is most important and optimize the depth correction for it.
2) Camera pointed downward; typically the depth of the bottom should be set, or measured depth plus visibility distance.
3) Dive-computer stayed at a different depth than the subject.
4) Measurement error - possible cause is depth-measurement interval being rather large.

So, if you detect a color-cast induced by wrong depth assumption, you can force an alternative depth on per-image basis:
- press "Override Depth" button to open a table with image names and four depth values (left to right):
-- min/max depth readings close to the image taking time
-- estimated depth according to the above readings
-- the ultimate depth to use in color computation - this value appears in a text entry, and this is the one you can override
- just type the desired depth values in the entries of the images you want to override, and then close the depth-override window
-- even if the depth-override window is kept open, new depth values are already applied 
- Press "ProcessChangedPhotos" to recompute only the photos affected by your depth-override decisions.

It is possible to specify depth-override values by means of any standard text editor - just edit Data/TODO_depth_ovrd.csv file; save it as plain text, close the editor, press "ProcessChangedPhotos" button in UWIC. Be sure not to open depth-override window in parallel.
